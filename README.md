Keyboard-related settings.

I'm at the start of my journey to customize my keyboard/s settings. This repo will serve as a guide/reminder for my future self on tools I've found useful and as a storage of keyboard settings.

## keyd
[keyd](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd/tree/master) is a tool written in C for Linux systems that allows for system-level key-bindings.
I have used it for the following key maps:
- Home row mods (GACS)
- j+k -> escape
- leftAlt -> tab
- alt+h -> left
- alt+k -> up
- alt+j -> down
- alt+l -> right
- alt+a -> home
- alt+; -> end
- space+j -> backspace
- space+k -> enter
- space+l -> delete
