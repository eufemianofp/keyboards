Keyboard-related settings.

I'm at the start of my journey to customize my keyboard/s settings. This repo will serve as a guide/reminder for my future self on tools I've found useful and a storage of keyboard settings.

## keyd
[keyd](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd/tree/master) is a tool written in C for Linux systems that allows for system-level key-bindings. I have used it to remap the caps lock key to ctrl on hold and escape on tap.
